    "# Simple Rota Reader 3 - Problems and Hosting\n",

    "There's no point creating these icalendar files if we can't get them into our applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could post out the .ics files to everyone who wants them and then they import them directly into their calendar applications. A better plan would be to place the .ics files on a webserver somewhere, point our applications to that and then update the .ics files as needed.\n",

    "A good place to put these would be on your own webserver - but you may not have one. Another good, free place is on <http://github.io>\n",

    "## Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all rotas come as Excel files. Switching from reading excel files to csv files isn't a completely simple switch. There are two modules I know of that can read excel: `pandas` and `xlrd` but they both have different APIs to that of `csv`.\n",

    "We'll use `xlrd` as it is the most simple. The basic reading code is as follows:"
