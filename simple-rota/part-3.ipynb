    "# Simple Rota Reader 3 - Problems and Hosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! We have a way of creating rota calendars for individual doctors. Albeit from a simple rota. But before we move on we should look at few potential issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scripting vs. Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be helpful to restructure our file so that we can test individual functions in it using the python interpreter and can pass in arguments in like a normal program - for example a different filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wrap our main function code into a function, say `parse_file_and_create_calendars` and then use the `ArgumentParser` from the `argparse` module we can pass in default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally if we add an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block - this will only execute if we run the script directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    from argparse import ArgumentParser\n",
    "    parser = ArgumentParser(description='Simple Rota reader')\n",
    "    parser.add_argument('filename', nargs='?', help='the rota filename', default='simple_rota.csv')\n",
    "    parser.add_argument('directory', nargs='?', help='output directory', default='generated')\n",
    "    parser.add_argument('--sheet', nargs='?', type=int, help='excel spreadsheet id', default=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "    args = parser.parse_args()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    parse_file_and_create_calendars(args.filename, args.sheet, args.directory)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will allow us to `import simple_rota3` our script into the interpreter and test functions. We can adjust our code and reload the code with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> from importlib import reload\n",
    ">>> reload(simple_rota3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hosting\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no point creating these icalendar files if we can't get them into our applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could post out the .ics files to everyone who wants them and then they import them directly into their calendar applications. A better plan would be to place the .ics files on a webserver somewhere, point our applications to that and then update the .ics files as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good place to put these would be on your own webserver - but you may not have one. Another good, free place is on <http://github.io>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all rotas come as Excel files. Switching from reading excel files to csv files isn't a completely simple switch. There are two modules I know of that can read excel: `pandas` and `xlrd` but they both have different APIs to that of `csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use `xlrd` as it is the most simple. The basic reading code is as follows:"

    "* The default formats for date etc. aren't even stored in the file - so when you pass an excel file to computer in a different locale - these will be displayed in their locale. Which is OK if Excel has auto-typed everything correctly but if not... (Say you have part numbers which have a '/' in them, every one that is a valid day/month pair or month/year pair will be autoconverted to a date unless you're very careful.)\n",
    "* Another issue is that even when excel has typed things correctly there are many issues with these types:\n",
    " * Integers are not floating point - try: `=111111111 * 111111111 - 12345678987654300` and compare it with python's answer.\n",
    " * Decimals are not floating point - try: `=22.26 - 21.29`, (here python also gives the incorrect answer.)\n",
